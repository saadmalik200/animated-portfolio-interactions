The website you will be making is:

## Keep in Mind

- Notice the hover effects on the links in the navigation bar and the dropdown menus on _Services_ and _About Me_
- There is an animation reveal when the user hovers over the _info_ icon
- There is an animation and neon effect on the _Home_ and _About_ buttons at the bottom of the page
- Make the page as pixel-perfect to the reference site as possible

Experiment and have fun!
